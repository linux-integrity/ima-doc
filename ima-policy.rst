Measure Policy Rule Design
===================================

While a good design should measure all security relevant events, there
are good reasons to not simply "measure everything".

As described below, only stable, mostly read-only, well known files
and other items should be measured.  Examples are binaries, shared
libraries, and system configuration files. Frequently changing files
should not be measured.  Examples are log files or databases.

1. **Performance**.  The TPM is slow. This not an issue if files
rarely change, since IMA tracks measurements and does not re-measure
a file that has not changed.  However, files that change often will
cause frequent measurements, degrading performance.

2. **Event log size**: Each log record can be 300 bytes. A system
might have 5000 records at boot and grow as large as 100,000 records
over time. This is reasonable unless the platform is memory
constrained.

Beware that, if an installation expects a ``kexec``, and assuming that
the event log is carried across the kexec, the size will grow roughly
linearly with the number of kexec's.

See :ref:`kexec-ima-impact`.

However, if a measured file changes often, there is no longer any
typical log size.  Each change can cause a new measurement and
millions of measurements are possible.

3. **Verifier performance**: The verifier uses a TPM ``quote`` as an
integrity signature over the IMA event log. It needs all events to
verify the log.

A verifier typically caches results and does an incremental
attestation.  Only events since the last quote need be sent and
processed. Once most events have been processed, the size of the event
log is immaterial.

However, policy rules that cause continuous new measurements will
require those measurements to be sent to the verifier and processed.
This increases the network and verifier load, important as the
verifier scales to support many attesters.

4. **Security assertions**: The end goal of measurements and
attestation is to permit the verifier to assess the security state of
the attester.  The verifier does this by comparing the event log
hashes to approved lists.  For example, the verifier might have a list
of file hashes for executables and shared libraries.

However, files that change often will not have approved hashes.
Hashes cannot be reversed to calculate the file.  Therefore, the
verifier cannot assess its security properties.

.. _appraise-policy-rule-design:

Appraise Policy Rule Design
===================================

Appraisal rules are restricted based on ``func`` values as shown in
the :ref:`func` table.

The kernel configuration (see :ref:`appraise`) and the boot command
line (see :ref:`boot-command-line-arguments` and
:ref:`ima-appraise-policies`) determine the ``appraise`` policy rules.
The typical initial setting :ref:`ima-policy-appraise-tcb` appraises
all files owned by root.

IMA can prevent a signed file from being altered online if it is
included in the ``FILE_CHECK`` rule for write.

Rules should not appraise pseudo-filesystems (e.g., debugfs,
securityfs, or selinuxfs). They are not real files and do not support
extended attributes. Add ``dont_appraise`` rules for these
pseudo-filesystems.  See :ref:`ima-policy-appraise-tcb` for an
example.

This example appraisal policy excludes several pseudo-filesystems.

::

   # PROC_SUPER_MAGIC
   dont_appraise fsmagic=0x9fa0
   # SYSFS_MAGIC
   dont_appraise fsmagic=0x62656572
   # DEBUGFS_MAGIC
   dont_appraise fsmagic=0x64626720
   # RAMFS_MAGIC
   dont_appraise fsmagic=0x858458f6
   # DEVPTS_SUPER_MAGIC
   dont_appraise fsmagic=0x1cd1
   # BINFMTFS_MAGIC
   dont_appraise fsmagic=0x42494e4d
   # SECURITYFS_MAGIC
   dont_appraise fsmagic=0x73636673
   # SELINUXFS_MAGIC
   dont_appraise fsmagic=0xf97cff8c
   # SMACK_MAGIC
   dont_appraise fsmagic=0x43415d53
   # NSFS_MAGIC
   dont_appraise fsmagic=0x6e736673
   # CGROUP_SUPER_MAGIC
   dont_appraise fsmagic=0x27e0eb
   # CGROUP2_SUPER_MAGIC
   dont_appraise fsmagic=0x63677270

Rules would not appraise log files, cache files, and other rapidly
changing files lacking a known trusted value.

One test configuration may be to appraise one filesystem, where all
files are signed, while not appraising another file system which
contains unsigned files being tested.

IMA does not prevent a file from being altered offline. An altered
file will (depending on policy rules) not be readable or executable.
E.g., :ref:`appraise-type` can require a signature.


.. _policy-rule-order:

Policy Rule Order
===================================

Policy rules can originate from several sources.  They are determined in this order

#. :ref:`built-in-policy-rules` for measurement.  See :ref:`ima-policy-tcb`
#. :ref:`architecture-specific-policy-rules` from
   :ref:`kernel-configuration-options` such as
   :ref:`config-ima-arch-policy`.
#. :ref:`built-in-policy-rules` for secure boot appraisal.  See
   :ref:`ima-policy-secure-boot`.
#. Build time policy rules from :ref:`kernel-configuration-options`
   for finer control than :ref:`ima-policy-secure-boot`.

   a. :ref:`config-ima-appraise-require-module-sigs`.
   b. :ref:`config-ima-appraise-require-firmware-sigs`.
   c. :ref:`config-ima-appraise-require-kexec-sigs`.
   d. :ref:`config-ima-appraise-require-policy-sigs`.
#. Build time :ref:`built-in-policy-rules` for appraisal.  See :ref:`ima-policy-appraise-tcb`.
#. Build time :ref:`built-in-policy-rules` for measure.  See :ref:`ima-policy-critical-data`.

After a :ref:`custom-policy` is loaded, the order becomes:

#. :ref:`architecture-specific-policy-rules` from
   :ref:`kernel-configuration-options` such as
   :ref:`config-ima-arch-policy`.
#. Build time :ref:`kernel-configuration-options` for finer control.

   a. :ref:`config-ima-appraise-require-module-sigs`.
   b. :ref:`config-ima-appraise-require-firmware-sigs`.
   c. :ref:`config-ima-appraise-require-kexec-sigs`.
   d. :ref:`config-ima-appraise-require-policy-sigs`.

#.  :ref:`custom-policy`.

:ref:`ima-policy` can be specified multiple times, and the result is
the concatenation of the policies in a hard coded order listed in
:ref:`ima-policy`.

.. _reading-policies:

Reading Policies
===================================

The policy rules currently in effect can be viewed in the pseudo-file
``/sys/kernel/security/ima/policy``.

The policy can be read if :ref:`config-ima-read-policy` is true when building
the kernel.

Initial Policy Rules
===================================

The initial policy rules are in effect before possible replacement by
a :ref:`custom-policy`.

These include:

* :ref:`built-in-policy-rules`
* :ref:`architecture-specific-policy-rules`

.. _built-in-policy-rules:

Built-in Policy Rules
------------------------------------

Built-in policy rules are compiled into the kernel. Their contents
cannot be changed but can be replaced by a
:ref:`boot-time-custom-policy` and/or a :ref:`runtime-custom-policy`.
They are specified using the :ref:`boot-command-line-arguments`
:ref:`ima-policy`.

The boot command selects the built-in policy. The command can be
specified on the boot command line (single boot) or in the grub
configuration file (persistent).

The pseudofile ``/proc/cmdline`` will display the boot command line.
``grubby --info=ALL`` displays all the kernel choices.

Specifying none of the below ``ima_policy`` options on the boot
command line yields a policy with no built-in policy rules.

.. _architecture-specific-policy-rules:

Architecture Specific Policy Rules
------------------------------------

The architecture specific policy rules depend on the secure boot state
(x86) or the secure and trusted boot states (Power). The rules added
when secure boot is enabled in the firmware cannot be replaced by a
:ref:`custom-policy`.

For the effect on policies, see :ref:`config-ima-arch-policy`.

For EFI-based systems, the secure boot state can be tested with

::

   mokutil --sb-state

For a PowerVM guest, the secure boot state can be tested by viewing
the device tree property in the pseudo-file
``/proc/device-tree/ibm,secure-boot``.  The values are:

* 0 - secure boot disabled
* 1 - audit only, secure boot not enforced, failures are logged
* 2 = secure boot enabled

On OpenPOWER systems, the secure boot state is indicated by the
presence of the device tree property
``/proc/device-tree/ibm,secure-boot/os-secureboot-enforcing``.  If the
pseudo-file exists, secure boot is enabled,  else it is disabled.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  ``tcb`` applies an IMA policy that meets the needs of the Trusted
  Computing Base (TCB).

  The rules measure all programs directly executed or mmap'd for
  execution (such as shared libraries).  They measure files opened by
  root ((euid, uid) == 0) with the read bit set.  It measures all
  kernel modules loaded and all firmware loaded.

  The policy excludes some "pseudo" filesystem from measurement. See
  :ref:`custom-policy` for recommendations related to ``tmpfs`` files.

which requires all files to be signed.  Hashes are insufficiant.

.. _ima-policy-fail-securely:

ima_policy=fail_securely
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``fail_securely`` affects the appraisal of untrusted mounted
filesystems. An example is a FUSE filesystem.

   FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) filesystems are inherently untrusted.  A
   file's data content presented on file open is not necessarily the same
   file data content subsequently accessed.  For this reason, files on
   unprivileged mounted FUSE filesystems are never trusted; files on
   privileged FUSE mounted filesystems are "trusted" unless the boot
   command line policy is specified.

When present, appraisal of untrusted mounted filesystems always
fails.  An example is a FUSE filesystem even when mounted by root.

When absent, they do not fail.

A filesystem not mounted by root is considered untrusted and always
fails appraisal.

IMA Template Configuration
-----------------------------------

ima_template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This boot command line argument sets a logging format for the
:ref:`ima-event-log`.  See :ref:`config-ima-default-template` for the
compiled-in default. See :ref:`built-in-templates` for legal values.
See the values in :ref:`template-data-fields` for the
effects.

ima_template_fmt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This boot command line argument sets a logging format for the
:ref:`ima-event-log`. See :ref:`template-data-fields`
for the custom template legal values.

   Note: The ``n`` field is deprecated.

.. warning::

   **FIXME This needs an example, like d|n. Are there quotes or
   brackets?**


.. _custom-policy:

Custom Policy
===================================

A custom policy may specified at boot time or at runtime, or
both. Either replaces the :ref:`built-in-policy-rules` enabled on the
boot command line.  The policy file has one
:ref:`policy-syntax-action` per line.  Empty lines are forbidden.
Lines beginning with ``#`` are comments.  Use

::

   dmesg

to check for errors.

If running appraisal and

::

   appraise func=POLICY_CHECK appraise_type=imasig

is part of the built-in policy, the custom policy file is itself
appraised. For example, the :ref:`boot-time-custom-policy`, typically
``/etc/ima/ima-policy`` has to be signed.  :ref:`policy-signature`
shows a signing utility.

.. note::

   The built-in policy :ref:`ima-policy-tcb` excludes files in
   ``tmpfs``. This should be replaced with a custom policy where all
   :ref:`func` rules except :ref:`func-file-check` come before the
   ``dont_measure`` rules so that measurements trigger even for items
   in ``tmpfs``.


.. _boot-time-custom-policy:

Boot Time Custom Policy
-----------------------------------

The boot time policy, if specified in ``/etc/ima/ima-policy``, is
loaded during Linux initialization. That is, early in Linux boot, a
built-in policy is used. See :ref:`built-in-policy-rules`. At some
point, the file system becomes available and ``/etc/ima/ima-policy``
becomes the IMA policy, replacing the built-in policy.

The IMA policy pathname is configurable in dracut ``/etc/sysconfig/ima``.

If ``/etc/ima/ima-policy`` does not exist, IMA keeps using the
:ref:`built-in-policy-rules`.  policy. **Any malformed policy,
including an empty file (zero length) is illegal and will prevent
Linux from booting.**

**Test the custom policy first.** Put the policy in a temporary file,
then load the file to ``/sys/kernel/security/ima/policy``. On failure,
use ``dmesg`` to check for errors.

   Note that this test does not always work for policy rules written
   in terms of SELinux labels.

   For example, a test may succeed on a platform with SELinux enabled.
   If, after reboot SELinux is disabled or the SELinux policy has not
   been loaded, the IMA policy rule will prevent the boot.

   If, after a successful test, the SELinux policy is updated and
   labels present in the IMA policy do not exist anymore, the IMA
   policy rule will prevent the boot.

.. _runtime-custom-policy:

Runtime Custom Policy
-----------------------------------

The policy in ``/sys/kernel/security/ima/policy`` can be augmented at
runtime.

If a boot time custom policy was not specified, the first runtime
custom policy replaces the existing policy.

If a boot time custom policy was specified, the first runtime custom
policy, if permitted, is appended to the existing policy.

Subsequent updates, if permitted, are appends.

If the kernel is configured with :ref:`config-ima-write-policy` false,
one update is permitted, which is either the
:ref:`boot-time-custom-policy` or a :ref:`runtime-custom-policy`.  If
true, the policy may be updated multiple times.

Any of the below methods can be used if policies are permitted to be
unsigned (see :ref:`func-policy-check`):

::

   echo /home/user/tmpfile > /sys/kernel/security/ima/policy
   cp tmpfile /sys/kernel/security/ima/policy
   cat tmpfile > /sys/kernel/security/ima/policy

A malformed policy will report the error ``Invalid argument`` and
``dmesg`` will display the error. An unsigned or incorrectly signed
policy file will report the error ``Permission denied``.

The latter two methods stream the policy rules line by line. They will
not succeed when the rule :ref:`func-policy-check` is present,
requiring a policy to be signed.

The first method, required when appraisals require signed policies,
streams the fully qualified path name. The slash (/) as the first
character causes the stream to be treated as a file name rather than a
list of policy rules. The kernel reads the entire file and can check
the signature before loading the policy.
